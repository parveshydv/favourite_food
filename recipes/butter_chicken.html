    <h3>About Butter Chicken</h2>
    <p><em>Butter chicken</em> is prepared with marinated chicken that's first grilled and then served in a rich gravy<em>(a.k.a. curry) </em> made with tomato, butter, and a special spice blend as a base.
        Unlike most Indian curries where the preparation of the base starts with a blend of onion and a ginger garlic paste cooked in oil, butter chicken uses tomato as a base and is cooked in butter, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. Cashews and almonds add to the sweetness and richness of the dish.</p>
    <p>The roots of butter chicken are only as recent as the 1950s, when it was developed accidentally by the chef of famous restaurant Moti Mahal in Delhi, the capital of India. For chef Kundan Lal Gujral, it was a common practice to throw in butter, tomatoes, and leftover tandoori chicken into a pot to make use of the leftovers.
        Little did he know that this dish would become their best seller and put them on the map. Now the recipe is adapted by restaurants across the world, though it's really a “special occasion” dish in Indian homes.</p>
