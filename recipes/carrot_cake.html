    <h3>History Of Carrot Cake</h3>
    <p>Believe it or not, carrots have been used in place of sugar for centuries! Sweeteners were often scarce or expensive, so people had to get creative with what they had at home. Since carrots are one of the sweetest and most accessible veggies out there, the use of carrots as natural sweeteners only made sense.</p>
    <p>The practice of using carrots in desserts started in medieval times. Cooks would make a type of “pudding” with boiled carrots, spices, flour and eggs. Once ovens were more readily available, it became much more popular to bake desserts instead of boiling or steaming them. Adding more flour and fat to the mix is what eventually gave carrot cake that lighter, fluffier texture we all know and love today.</p>
